                <h5>Reproduce the work</h5>
                <p>Is one of the exclusive rights that the owner of a musical
                  work has under intellectual property law. It means to make
                  copies of the original work in any form or manner, such as
                  CDs, tapes, digital files, sheet music, etc. For example, if I
                  write a song and record it in a studio, I have the right to
                  reproduce my song in any format I want. I also have the right
                  to authorize or prevent others from reproducing my song. If
                  someone wants to make a cover version of my song, they need to
                  get my permission and pay me a royalty fee. If someone
                  reproduces my song without my permission, they are infringing
                  my intellectual property right and I can take legal action
                  against them.
