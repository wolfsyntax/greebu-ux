Reproduce the work is one of the exclusive rights that the owner of a musical work has under intellectual property law. It means to make copies of the original work in any form or manner, such as CDs, tapes, digital files, sheet music, etc. For example, if I write a song and record it in a studio, I have the right to reproduce my song in any format I want. I also have the right to authorize or prevent others from reproducing my song. If someone wants to make a cover version of my song, they need to get my permission and pay me a royalty fee. If someone reproduces my song without my permission, they are infringing my intellectual property right and I can take legal action against them.
